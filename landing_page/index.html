                Depression is a mental health disorder that affects an individual's mood, thoughts, and overall behavior. It is characterized by feelings of intense sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness that persist over a long period, typically lasting for weeks or even months. Depression affects a person's ability to enjoy the simple pleasures of life, perform daily activities, and interact with others. <br><br>Depression can lead to suicide or passive suicide in a number of ways. Individuals experiencing depression may feel overwhelming sadness, hopelessness, and despair. These emotions can be so intense that the individual may feel like there is no way out of their situation. They may feel like they are unable to cope with the challenges in their life, and that there is no hope for a better future.
                <br><br>These feelings of hopelessness and despair can lead to suicidal ideation. The individual may start thinking about ending their own life as a way to escape their pain. When these thoughts become more persistant, it puts a person at a higher risk for suicide or passive suicide. They might start to withdraw from their social groups, lose interest in activities they once enjoyed, and become increasingly isolated.</p>

            <p><span class="para"><strong>Causes of Depression</strong></span><br><br>
                <span style="font-size: 20px;">Depression can be caused by a variety of factors, including biological, environmental, and psychological factors.</span><br><br>
                Some individuals may be genetically predisposed to depression, meaning that they have a family history of the disorder.<br>
                Environmental factors, such as stress, trauma, and chronic illness, can also trigger depression.<br>
                Feelings of loneliness and social isolation can also lead to depression.<br>
                People who lack a support network or meaningful connections to others are more likely to experience depressive symptoms. This can be due to the lack of opportunities to feel validated and supported by others. <br>
                Negative thought patterns and beliefs about oneself and the world can also trigger depression. For example, individuals who have a tendency to ruminate on negative thoughts and experiences may find themselves experiencing depressive symptoms.<br><br>It is important to recognize these potential causes and seek professional help if experiencing depressive symptoms. With proper assessment and treatment, individuals can learn to manage depression and live fulfilling lives.

                The symptoms of depression can vary from person to person, but generally include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness. Other common symptoms of depression include loss of interest or pleasure in activities that one used to enjoy, excessive fatigue or feelings of low energy, difficulty sleeping or oversleeping, changes in appetite, difficulty concentrating, feeling worthless, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. <br><br>One of these symptoms is passive suicidal ideation, which involves having thoughts about death or suicide without any active plans to carry them out. Passive suicide involves engaging in behaviors that lead to death, such as excessive alcohol or drug use, overeating or under-eating, or neglecting their health, without actively trying to end their own life. Other symptoms of depression may include irritability, anxiety, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, trouble making decisions or concentrating, changes in weight or sleep patterns.<br><br> These symptoms can vary in intensity and duration and may interfere with one's ability to function normally in daily life. People with depression may also experience physical symptoms such as headaches, body aches, and digestive problems.
